# react-native-example-master
Expo is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required (see Caveats).

Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
npm install -g expo-cli
Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start
This will start a development server for you.
